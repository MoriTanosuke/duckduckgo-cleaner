I decided to build my own [userscript][2] (for [Tampermonkey][0]) to block
search results from [DuckDuckGo][1]. There are a lot of domains that
I consider SPAM or that I simply don't want to see in my results,
and this userscript removes them.

Please note that this script only works on the non-javascript version of
[DuckDuckGo][1], which is my preferred way of searching.
